**Monument Valley**, meaning "valley of the rocks", is a region of the Colorado Plateau characterized by a cluster of
sandstone buttes, with the largest reaching 1,000 ft (300 m) above the valley floor.[^1] The most famous butte
formations are located in northeastern Arizona along the Utah–Arizona state line. The valley is considered sacred by the
[Navajo Nation](Q1783171), the Native American people within whose reservation it lies.[^2]

Major rock formations include [West](image/zoomto/pct:10.94,27.88,21.05,30){: label="West Mitten Butte"} and [East
Mitten](image/zoomto/pct:40.59,35.80,21.91,25){: label="East Mitten Butte"} Buttes, [Merrick
Butte](image/zoomto/pct:67.68,34.23,23.22,27), Hunts Mesa, Eagle Mesa, Sentinel Mesa, Brighams Tomb, Castle Rock,
Stagecoach, Big Indian, Rain God Mesa, Spearhead Mesa, Mitchell Mesa, Mitchell Butte, Gray Whiskers, Elephant Butte,
Camel Butte, Cly Butte, King-on-his-Throne, Rooster Rock, and Setting Hen. Another notable formation is [Totem
Pole](Q7828304), a highly eroded butte remanent. The valley also includes large stone structures, such as the "Eye of
the Sun". [People](image/zoomto/pct:48.49,66.82,11.31,7.44)

# Geography and geology

[Monument Valley](map/flyto/37.02828,-110.23819,11) is part of the Colorado Plateau. The elevation of the valley floor
ranges from 5,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. The floor is largely siltstone of the Cutler Group, or sand derived
from it, deposited by the meandering rivers that carved the valley. The valley's vivid red coloration comes from iron
oxide exposed in the weathered siltstone. The darker, blue-gray rocks in the valley get their color from manganese
oxide. For tourists doing a national park tour, Monument Valley is situated between [Arches National
Park](map/flyto/Q223969,12) and the [Grand Canyon](map/flyto/Q118841,12).

The buttes arising from the valley floor are clearly stratified, with three principal layers. The lowest layer is the
Organ Rock Shale, the middle is de Chelly Sandstone, and the top layer is the Moenkopi Formation capped by Shinarump
Conglomerate.

Between 1945 and 1967, the southern extent of the Monument Upwarp was mined for uranium, which occurs in scattered areas
of the Shinarump Conglomerate; vanadium and copper are associated with uranium in some deposits.


# Tourism and media

Monument Valley includes much of the area surrounding Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, a Navajo Nation equivalent to
a national park. Oljato, for example, is also within the area designated as Monument Valley. Visitors may drive through
the park on a 17-mile (27 km) dirt road. Parts of Monument Valley, such as Mystery Valley and Hunts Mesa, are accessible
only by guided tour.

Monument Valley has been featured in many forms of media since the 1930s. Famed director John Ford used the location for
a number of his Westerns. Film critic Keith Phipps wrote that "its five square miles [13 km2] have defined what decades
of moviegoers think of when they imagine the American West".[^3]
