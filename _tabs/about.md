## Welcome to Spartina

**Spartina** is my digital workbench—a place for exploring AI, emerging technologies, and hands-on making. Like the resilient coastal grass it's named for, this blog thrives at the intersections: where software meets hardware, theory meets practice, and curiosity leads to experimentation.

I'm interested in what happens when you take new tools—AI models, development platforms, open-source projects—and actually build something with them. Not just conceptual discussions, but real implementations, working prototypes, and the messy process of learning by doing.

You'll find projects here ranging from practical applications to experimental explorations: AI assistants trained on specific knowledge bases, automation tools, DIY electronics, and whatever else catches my attention at the edges of what's possible.

## Featured Project: SCHH Commons AI Assistant

One of my main projects is the **[SCHH Commons AI Assistant](/schh-ai-assistant)**, a specialized tool I built for Sun City Hilton Head residents. It demonstrates what's possible when you combine AI, information architecture, and user-centered design to solve real problems.

The project centers on an **AI Assistant powered by NotebookLM**—Google's document-grounded AI tool—connected to a curated knowledge base of community documents. Instead of residents hunting through scattered PDFs, websites, and newsletters, they can simply ask questions in natural language and get accurate answers drawn from official sources.

The **Knowledge Base** includes governance documents, lifestyle information, club resources, and other materials relevant to the community. It's continuously expanding based on resident feedback and needs.

This is a working example of how AI can make information more accessible without replacing authoritative sources—it augments rather than replaces, making existing knowledge easier to find and understand. I'll be writing more about the technical implementation, challenges, and lessons learned as the project evolves.

## Background

I'm **Ron Snyder**, a veteran and technologist with a background that spans defense work, non-profit research, and community-focused projects. I spent ten years in the U.S. Air Force, twenty years in the defense industry, and nearly two decades in academic R&D—leading AI and information projects that helped institutions share knowledge more effectively.

Now, in what some might call retirement, I'm focused on building things that interest me and solving problems I encounter in my own community. The skills are the same—research, development, systems thinking—but the application is more personal and immediate.

## What You'll Find Here

**Project updates and builds** - Documentation of things I'm making, from AI experiments to DIY projects

**Technical explorations** - Deep dives into tools, platforms, and technologies worth understanding

**Research and investigations** - Using AI research tools and traditional methods to dig into questions that matter—from persistent community rumors to understanding complex topics. Consolidated findings shared so others don't have to do the same digging.

**Lessons learned** - What works, what doesn't, and why—shared so others can learn from my mistakes

**Process and methodology** - How I approach problems, research solutions, and iterate on ideas

This isn't a tutorial site or a news aggregator. It's a working notebook for someone learning in public, building at the edges of emerging technology, and documenting the journey.
